# Geospatial Data Visualisation Tool

This tool can be used to quickly visualise geospatial data on the map of Finland. The application accepts data in CSV format and currently supports numerical data on the municipal level. Support for different regional areas as well as postal code areas will be added in the near future. After that, the goal is to add functionality for coordinate based data that can be visualised, for example, with a Voronoi diagram or kriging interpolation.

The application uses [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org//) to draw a very detailed version of the interactive map. In the future a feature for saving the results into an image file will be provided.
